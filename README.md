# angular-semanticui-satellizer-seed

This project is basically the same AngularJS application skeleton available here [angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed). I just added the Semantic-UI for frontend and [Satellizer](https://github.com/sahat/satellizer) for token based social network authentication. Semantic-UI is gaining momentum as CSS framework. Also, nowadays, every web apps requires authentication system from social network. So, I thought Satellizer can also be a good addition.

This seed does not contain any sample AngularJS app, only the development frameworks and tools.
